Quantity in Lots list
=====================

Adds the *Quantity* and *Forecast quantity* columns to lots list.

When the list is opened from the Lot field of stock move, these columns will
show the available stock of lots in the origin location of move.
When the list is opened from other sides, like the menu, the columns are shown
empty because there isn't any location to calculate the stock.
